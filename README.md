# Discount Calculator (Python)

## Overview
This project is a simple Python application that calculates the final price of a product after applying a discount percentage. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, type conversion, arithmetic operations, and formatted output.

## Features
- Accepts product price input from the user  
- Accepts discount percentage input  
- Calculates the discounted price  
- Displays the result formatted to two decimal places  

## Concepts Applied
- User input handling  
- Data type conversion (`float`)  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Percentage calculation  
- Formatted string literals (f-strings)  

## How It Works
1. The user enters the original product price.  
2. The user enters the discount percentage.  
3. The program calculates the discount amount.  
4. The final price is displayed with two decimal places.  

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.  
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.  
3. Run the following command:

```bash

Example
Enter the product price: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 10
The new price is 90.00
